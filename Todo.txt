 • Create a sword skill that is trained by attacking physically while using a sword
 • Create a bow skill that is trained by shooting a bow (create bow item and once its equipped, use A to shoot a bow)
 • Place health bars overtop of character heads (use charge meter.dmi for huds)
 • Skills dont save on hotslot after you log out
 • Add dragging effect while you’re placing a skill in hotspot (S to bring up skills, I to bring up inventory)

i don’t mean sword skill literally, but like, in the attacking and shooting bow verbs, pretty much check to see if they have the weapon on, and then give some exp points

NEW ADDONS

Fix Monster Attacking System
- Boundary boxes are out of whack
- Monsters should start attacking players a reasonable distance upon seeing me
- Monsters should start being aggro depending on the level of player (so if monster is way above player level, the   aggro factor is low, if they’re around player level and way below player level the aggro factor is high)

When you’re accepting a quest, it shows black boxes above the dialogue which shows all the rewards, i cant figure out how to put rewards in those boxes
