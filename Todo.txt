 • Create a sword skill that is trained by attacking physically while using a sword
 • Create a bow skill that is trained by shooting a bow (create bow item and once its equipped, use A to shoot a bow)
 • Place health bars overtop of character heads (use charge meter.dmi for huds)
 • Skills dont save on hotslot after you log out
 • Add dragging effect while you’re placing a skill in hotspot (S to bring up skills, I to bring up inventory)

i don’t mean sword skill literally, but like, in the attacking and shooting bow verbs, pretty much check to see if they have the weapon on, and then give some exp points
